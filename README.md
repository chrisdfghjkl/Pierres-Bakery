* Bread -  Buy 2, get 1 free (every 3rd loaf of bread is free.). A single loaf costs $5, two loaves costs $10, and three loaves cost $10.
* Pastry - Buy 1 for $2 or 3 for $5. Four pastries costs $7, five pastries costs $9, and six pastries costs $10.
All functionality for the models should be tested.
